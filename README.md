# Project 4 Webservers
For this project, you will write two webservers that provide a Restful API to access information about hotels and hotel reviews:

- A webserver (HttpServer) that uses raw sockets to communicate with clients 
- A webserver (JettyServer) that uses Jetty/servlets 

Requirements for each of the two servers and the API are described in the pdf of Canvas.
